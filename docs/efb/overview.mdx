# Overview

The electronic flight bag is a tool that allows you to view charts, operational flight plans and routings, track your flight, check weather conditions and more. The EFB integrates with a multitude of third party services, such as Navigraph and FlyByWire SimBridge, to provide the best experience.

:::note

Unlike most other EFBs in simulators, the 74S EFB is inspired by a set of real-world EFB software and apps. We think this approach makes its use more immersive.
