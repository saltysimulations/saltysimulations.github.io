# Maps

:::info note

If you have a Navigraph Unlimited subscription, we recommend using the [Navigraph app](./navigraph) instead. The Navigraph app allows you to view enroute charts which are specifically geared towards aviation, and is more feature-rich.

This app is a simple map showing current aircraft position. The map can be zoomed in or out using the controls in the top right corner.
