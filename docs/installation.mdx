# Installation

:::note Stable or development version?

When installing the 74S, you can choose between two different versions. The stable version has less features than the development version, while also being generally less prone to bugs. We recommend the development version if you want to make use of the latest and greatest features.

:::

## FlyByWire Installer

We recommend installing via the [FlyByWire Installer](https://api.flybywiresim.com/installer), which provides a seamless and easy-to-use way to install and keep the Salty 74S updated. Simply choose your preferred version and install.

## Alternative Methods

:::caution

To avoid issues with installation, we highly recommend using the FlyByWire installer instead of downloading directly.

:::

Manual installation is possible by downloading either the [stable](https://github.com/saltysimulations/salty-747/releases/latest/download/salty-747.zip) or [development](https://github.com/saltysimulations/salty-747/releases/download/vdev/salty-747-dev.zip) versions and copying the contents of the archive into your `Community` folder. Depending on the platform you bought Microsoft Flight Simulator on, the location of this folder will differ.

    <TabItem value="ms" label="Microsoft Store" default>
        <CodeBlock>C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.FlightSimulator_[]\LocalCache\Packages\Community</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="steam" label="Steam">
        <CodeBlock>C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft Flight Simulator\Packages\Community</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="boxed" label="Boxed">
        <CodeBlock>C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\MSFSPackages\Community</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Note

If you customized the install location when installing MSFS, regardless of platform, your ``Community`` folder will be located wherever you installed it.
